    "                        - Anomalies Identified: The model detected multiple anomalies (red circles), representing instances where the detection rate significantly deviated from expected behavior. These could indicate system misconfigurations, unusual attack patterns, or delayed responses.\n",
    "                        - Overall Stability: The detection rate generally remains within the expected range (purple shaded region), indicating consistent performance of the detection mechanisms. However, periodic spikes and dips highlight areas for further investigation.\n",
    "                        - Spike Analysis: Spikes in detection rates may correlate with periods of heightened activity or improved detection capabilities, while dips could reflect potential monitoring gaps or delayed responses.\n",
    "                    ## Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "                        1. Investigate the root causes of anomalies to determine if they were triggered by system issues, attacker behavior, or external factors.\n",
    "                        2. Strengthen detection mechanisms during anticipated periods of increased activity, as identified in the intrusion attempts forecast.\n",
    "                        3. Conduct regular audits and testing of detection systems to ensure consistent and reliable performance.\n",
    "                        4. Optimize thresholds and refine detection logic to minimize false positives and negatives.\n",

    "                        2. Proactive Planning: The forecasted rise in intrusion attempts highlights the importance of scaling up security measures and optimizing response processes to handle the growing threat landscape.\n",
